OUTRUN Rust OpenGL Demo
------------------------------------
This is a just a small project showing how I got my hands on OpenGL using Rust. I used glium as my library of choice. Later, I decided to add an outrun theme to it with the scrolling grid.

Assuming you already have the Rust toolchain, building and running the project is as simple as cloning and typing `cargo run`.
